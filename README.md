# HSML
An attempt at making a chatbot in Python. Ths is for an EPQ Project. The 'bot' utilises a markup file to get responces. This project is nowhere near completed and is work in progress.
## Dependancies
* Python 2.7
* [Element Tree](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elementtree/) 
## Functionality
* Finds the most approriate responce based on a tag strength system
* Reads from a custom markup file
## Future Functionality
* Function calls from inside responces to allow the bot to collect data
* More intelligent ways to decide on a responce
* Sentiment analysis
* A HSML File creator to feed mass data into a HSML File

## Getting Started
Download the reposity and run the AlphaBot.py file. This will allow you to interact with the bot. 
In the file included, there are only about 3 or 4 set responces to play with - feel free to add your own markup and increase the bot's functionality.
